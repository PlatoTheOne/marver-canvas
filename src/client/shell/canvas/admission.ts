/**
 * Frame admission: how many iframes boot at once.
 *
 * Every frame on a board is a document booting on the ONE renderer main thread (~400 ms each for a
 * lo-fi React frame), and a batch that starts together finishes together: 64 started at once, the
 * first is ready at 25.6 s and the last at 26.0 s - the board is blank until the end. Admitted a few
 * at a time, the first is ready at 1.8 s and the board fills in view order for the same total
 * (research/hifi/bootscale.ts). The ready watchdog counts from admission, not from mount, so a
 * queued frame is never mistaken for a stalled one.
 *
 * A new batch admits ONE frame first (the quickest first content: one boot alone is ~550 ms, four
 * together ~1.8 s), then up to SLOTS at a time. Pure, apart from its timing: a board that mounts
 * registers every node, the shell fits the camera (App.tsx, a few tens of ms later), then the first
 * pump ranks them (visible first, nearest the centre of the canvas first); a freed slot pumps on
 * the next microtask, ranking again by the view of that moment.
